# Election Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit
The Colorado Board of Elections tasked me with completing an audit from a recent local congressional election in which three candidates ran for office. The audit was to include additional data about the following:

1. The voter turnout for each county
2. The percentage of votes from each county 
3. The county with the most votes

## Election-Audit Results

1. There were 369,711 total votes cast in the election.
2. There were a total of 3 counties that contributed to the election: Arapahoe, Denver and Jefferson. Arapahoe accounted for 6.7% of the election votes with 24,801 votes. Jefferson accounted for 10.5% of the elections votes, contributing 38,855 votes. The overwhelming majority, however, came from Denver, which accounted for a massive 82.8% of the election's votes logging 306,055 votes.
3. Denver had the largest number of votes, by far.
4. Raymon Anthony Doane accounted for 3.1% of the total votes, logging 11,606 votes. Charles Casper Stockham accounted for 23.0% of the election's votes with 85,213 votes. Diana DeGette accounted for 73.8% of all votes, logging a whopping 272,892 votes.
5. Diana Degette won the election with 272,892 votes, accounting for 73.8% of the total votes.

The figures are summarized in the image below.

## Election-Audit Summary

The Board should use the script I developed for future elections with some slight changes. For a larger scale election, like the US presidency, we would need to refactor the code to run smoother. It's possible an election of that scale would involve more candidates and a larger amount of counties (states if it's the US election). I would do some formatting changes with the final summary files to include updated counts as the election progressed, real time. It would also be nice to add borders to make the end file easier for the user to read. As it is now, the script works and gave us the detail that the board required from this congressional election.
